# Simple Calculator
The Simple Calculator project is a C implementation of a basic calculator. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, by taking input from the user and displaying the result on the console. The calculator is designed to be easy to use, with a simple command-line interface that guides the user through the process of entering the numbers and operation they want to perform.

## Usage
To use the Simple Calculator, simply run the `calculator.py` file from the command line. The program will prompt you to enter the first number, the operation you want to perform, and the second number. After you enter these values, the program will display the result of the operation on the console.

## Supported Operations
The Simple Calculator supports the following arithmetic operations:

1. Addition (+)

2. Subtraction (-)

3. Multiplication (*)

4. Division (/)


## Example
Here's an example of using the Simple Calculator to add two numbers:
```
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): +
Enter the second number: 3
Result: 8
```
